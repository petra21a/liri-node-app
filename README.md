## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. Tasks liri preforms includes: listing latest Twitter tweets, and searching song and movie titles. Liri is able to do this from a command line or file.

## Technical Approach
- The challenges to this assignment was both learning the basics of node (env, packages.json) as well as dealing with a few new APIs. In general the JavaScript was fairly straightforward, so I attempted to utilize 'const' more than previously.
